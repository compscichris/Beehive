Project Beehive is a simulator project that is used to write code to simulate drones.

The purpose of this project is to create a drone simulation that is relatively realistic, and applicable to situations like military usage,
construction testing, reconnaisance, monitoring, and delivery systems.

Benefits of this project: 
Will provide a way for me to practice programming methodologies, and create
a skeleton code that can be re-engineered into skeleton structure of an actual functioning drone software.


Phases of development:

Phase 1: Creation of basic backend representation of World and
