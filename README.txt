PROJECT BEEHIVE
Author: Christopher Chen
Date of creation 1/12/2024

UPDATED DESCRIPTION:

Project Beehive is a simulator project that is used to write code to simulate drones interacting in a large world.

The purpose of this project is to create a drone simulation that is relatively realistic, and applicable to situations like military usage,
construction testing, reconnaisance, monitoring, and delivery system potentials. Ideally, this is a video game like a flight simulator, or 
could be adapted to one in the future.

Benefits of this project: 
- Will provide a way for me to practice programming methodologies, and create
a skeleton code that can be re-engineered into skeleton structure of an actual functioning drone software.

AGILE METHODOLOGY: break this project into phases and emphasizes continuous collaboration and improvement
Practicing Scrum framework, with elements of Kanban

Phases of development:

Phase 1: Project Initialization and Early Planning 
Deadline 1/15/2024 (Pushed back to 4/25/2024)



Phase 2: Creation of basic backend elements of the simulation
Deadline 5/22/2024

Phase 3: Drone ability development
Deadline 9/25/2024
- Implement drone functions, actions, and decisions. Change of drone detection and communication radiuses when in motion.


Phase 4: Researching and implementing Graphic User Interface development of simulator


Phase 5: Researching 3D, refining Graphic User Interface
